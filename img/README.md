# Markdown Starter Worksheet
The main goal of MarkDown is to be easily written and easily read.  It uses "plain text" formatting and can be converted to HTML.  The most common use case I've come across to use Markdown is for ReadMe files, used, for example, for Github repos.  Markdown can also be used to create email.

Markdown, in comparison to HTML, is much simpler to read and write.  The average person can typically understand markdown and would be able to learn and write it much quicker than HTML.

Specifically, Visual Studio Code uses the [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) Markdown specification.
